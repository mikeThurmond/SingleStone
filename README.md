# SingleStone

From the SingleStone Dir run the following:
    dotnet run
    
- I opted for a sqlite database though given the datastructure and as mentioned in the directions, NoSql qould have been way easier.

- Things to add: Test suite, more validation checks and limits on dto strings, refactor to NoSql.
